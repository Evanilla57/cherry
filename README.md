# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

For this project, I refactored existing code to make an existing site more accessible. 

 Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. A greater focus on accessibility can help sites rank higher in search engines also helps companies avoid potential litigation which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

The goal of this project is to improve long-term sustainability, increase the efficiency of HTML and CSS, and expand the accessibility of the site itself.

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
